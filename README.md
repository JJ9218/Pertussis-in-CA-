### Limitations
When it comes to case rates, we have do not have data specifying age demographics. We know that pertussis disporotionally impacts children, especially in childcare and kindergarten. While we have vaccination rates specifically for this age group, this analysis would be more accurate with the inclusion of age groups or grade level to fully confirm the association between vaccine rates and case rate. California's Department of Public Health indicate that in 2014, over 11,000 cases were reported including 2 infant deaths. This outbreak also led to hundreds of hospitilzations. When vaccination rates were low in schools, there was an increased risk for infants and children becoming infected wih pertussis. While we know young children are disporportionately impacted with pertussis cases, our analysis would be strengthened if age demographics or grade level was incldued in the pertussis case rates dataset.  

Another limitation is the amount of schools who did not report vaccination rates. For kindegarten schools in CA, 4.2% failed to report vaccination rates, and 8.3% for childcare facilities. While this number is relatively low in comparison to the schools and facilities that have reported, having this information for the analysis would have strengthened the hypothesis of vaccination rates having an impact on case rates.
