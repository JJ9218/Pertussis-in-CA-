### Background
Pertussis, also reffered to as whooping cough, is a highly contagious airborne disease transmitted from person to person. The bacteria that causes whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis, disrupts the upper respiratory system by releasing toxins that cause airways to swell and damage to the cilia. Symptoms typically develop within the 5-10 days of infection, manifesting in its early stages as a mild cough, low-grade fever, runny or stuffed nose, and apnea. In its later stages (1-2 weeks after infection), symptoms may develop into uncontrolled coughing fits (paroxysms). Coughing fits can last up to 10 weeks, but typically occurs for 1-6 weeks. Younger children are disproportionately impacted by severe pertussis. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for pregnant women in their third trimester, and infants can be vaccinated with the DTaP series as early as 6 weeks. 

In California, over 11,000 cases were reported in 2014, resulting in two infant deaths and hundreds of hospitilizations. This highlighted the importance of increasing vaccination rates for child care facilities and primary schools, as schools with low vaccination rates have increased risk of pertussis outbreaks. Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease and with effective measures taken for schools and child care facilities, children are at a lower risk of being exposed and infected with the bacterial disease. 

### Project Overview
This project aims to address the importance of the DTaP vaccine for children in child care facilities and primary schools and its impact on reducing pertussis outbreaks in schools. It analyzes the correlation between average vaccination rates and case counts for child care and kindergarten schools from 2011-2020. 

### Data Sources
The data is sourced from California's Department of Public Health. By law, students are required to provide proof of immunization under the California Health and Safety Code Section 120325-75. Along with this policy, the California Code of Regulation Section 6075 requires annual reporting of student immuninizations.

2. Data reports for [Child Care Facilities](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/childcare-reports.aspx#) vaccination rates

### Data Cleaning and Preparation


### Key Aims
1. Did vaccination rates in child care facilties and kindergaten schools decrease pertussis case counts?
2. 

### Data Analysis

### Results

### Recommendations
Some considerations: 
Given the results, were there other ways that could have prevented pertussis cases? mechanisms for reducing airborne pathogens in schools (air filters)
Schools should report cases as well.


### Limitations
When it comes to case rates, we have do not have data specifying age demographics. We know that pertussis disporotionally impacts children, especially in childcare and kindergarten. While we have vaccination rates specifically for this age group, this analysis would be more accurate with the inclusion of age groups or grade level to fully confirm the association between vaccine rates and case counts. California's Department of Public Health indicate that in 2014, over 11,000 cases were reported including 2 infant deaths. This outbreak also led to hundreds of hospitilzations. When vaccination rates were low in schools, there was an increased risk for infants and children becoming infected wih pertussis. While we know young children are disporportionately impacted with pertussis cases, our analysis would be strengthened if age demographics or grade level was incldued in the pertussis case count dataset.  

Another limitation is the amount of schools who did not report vaccination rates. For kindegarten schools in CA, 4.2% failed to report vaccination rates, and 8.3% for childcare facilities. While this number is relatively low in comparison to the schools and facilities that have reported, having this information for the analysis would have strengthened the hypothesis of vaccination rates having an impact on cases.
